## 👨🏽‍💻 Experience

**Services developer** @ [Pets at Home](https://www.petsathome.com/) _(Nov 2021 - Present)_ <br>
Pets at Home is the UK's leading pet care business, providing food, toys and bedding, grooming services and veterinary services.

As a Services Developer at Pets at Home, I took ownership of enterprise-level internal systems and developed APIs for providing customer and product data. I also created Azure DevOps pipelines, containerized front-end apps using Docker, and advocated for a shift to business-driven requirements.

As an Analyst Programmer, I worked on multiple support and development projects for clients in the Oil and Gas, Pharmaceutical, and consumer goods industries. In this role, I communicated directly with stakeholders to understand requirements and generate user stories and estimates. I was responsible for developing new features and enhancements for existing products, and deploying them using Continuous Integration tools such as TeamCity and Azure DevOps.
