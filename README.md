- Created an Azure DevOps pipeline to build, test, and publish an Azure DevOps extension to Visual Studio marketplace and share with our organisation
- Containerised the front-end apps using Docker so they can be tested in the CI stage of deployment with testing tools such as [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) and [lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse#readme)
- Recognized the issues with the current requirement procurement process and advocated for a shift to business-driven requirements rather than solution-driven requirements
- **Tools:** ASP.NET Core 6 Web API, C#, Docker, Node.js, Azure, Pipelines
