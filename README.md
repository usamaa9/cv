## üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª Experience

**Services developer** @ [Pets at Home](https://www.petsathome.com/) _(Nov 2021 - Present)_ <br>
Pets at Home is the UK's leading pet care business, providing food, toys and bedding, grooming services and veterinary services.

As a Services Developer at Pets at Home, I took ownership of enterprise-level internal systems and developed APIs for providing customer and product data. I also created Azure DevOps pipelines, containerized front-end apps using Docker, and advocated for a shift to business-driven requirements.

**Technologies used:** ASP.NET Core 6 Web API, C#, Docker, Azure, Pipelines, [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) with CQRS pattern, [Mapster](https://github.com/MapsterMapper/Mapster), [Bogus](https://github.com/bchavez/Bogus), [Swagger](https://swagger.io/), [Specflow+ LivingDoc](https://specflow.org/)

Tech consultancy now [Hybrid Intelligence in Capegemini Engineering](https://www.capgemini.com/gb-en/solutions/data-driven-rd-engineering-manufacturing-operations/).

As an Analyst Programmer, I worked on multiple support and development projects for clients in the Oil and Gas, Pharmaceutical, and consumer goods industries. In this role, I communicated directly with stakeholders to understand requirements and generate user stories and estimates. I was responsible for developing new features and enhancements for existing products, and deploying them using Continuous Integration tools such as TeamCity and Azure DevOps.

I also took initiative to improve the code base and reduce technical debt throughout development. I developed Python and R packages to enable clients to ingest data and conduct analysis on a bespoke data platform, and created Power Apps to allow for easy data entry in remote areas.
