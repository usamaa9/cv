## 👨🏽‍💻 Experience

**Services developer** @ [Pets at Home](https://www.petsathome.com/) _(Nov 2021 - Present)_ <br>
_UK's leading pet care business, providing food, toys and bedding, grooming services, and veterinary services._

As a Services Developer at Pets at Home, I took ownership of enterprise-level internal systems and developed APIs for providing customer and product data. I also created Azure DevOps pipelines, containerized front-end apps using Docker, and advocated for a shift to business-driven requirements.

- Developing intermediate APIs which handle all of the orchestration and combining of different data sources and APIs for the front-end team so they only need to talk to one API for all their requirements
- Building and maintaining common projects so the rest of the back-end teams can quickly set up new APIs with the right enterprise standards

**Technologies used:** ASP.NET Core 6 Web API, C#, Docker, Azure, Pipelines, [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) with CQRS pattern, [Mapster](https://github.com/MapsterMapper/Mapster), [Bogus](https://github.com/bchavez/Bogus), [Swagger](https://swagger.io/), [Specflow+ LivingDoc](https://specflow.org/)

<br>

**Analyst Programmer** @ [Tessella](https://www.tessella.com/) _(Sep 2019 - Nov 2021)_ <br>
_Tech consultancy now Hybrid Intelligence in Capgemini Engineering_

Worked on multiple projects, both support and development, running in parallel with 5+ clients in several domains such as Oil and Gas,
Pharmaceutical, and consumer goods
- Communicated directly with stakeholders to understand requirements and use cases to generate user stories and estimates
- Developed new features and enhancements to current products to support client needs
- Took responsibility for deployment to multiple environments by using Continuous Integration tools such as TeamCity and Azure DevOps
- Developed Python and R packages that enabled the client to ingest data and conduct analysis on a bespoke data platform
- Created Power Apps to allow client ease of data entry in remote areas

**Technologies used:** C#, Python, R, Docker, JavaScript, SQL Server, MySQL, Azure, Power Apps, Power Automate, AWS

## 🥽Personal Projects
### 🚗 [Whiplog](https://whiplog.azurewebsites.net/)

Whiplog is the ultimate tool for managing your vehicle's road tax, MOT, and insurance. Simply create an account, add your vehicle's registration number, and we'll fetch and store the current road tax and MOT status for each car. You can also add insurance details and set up reminders for when your tax, MOT, and insurance expire.

I am using Django to create this website and will be hosting it on Azure.

## 👨🏽‍🎓 Education

**MMath&Phys(Hons)** in Mathematics and Physics (_First class_) <br>
_[University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) - Manchester, UK (2015 - 2019)_ <br>
**Masters Project**: _Modelling the internal flow of an immiscible droplet subject to a shear flow._

In this project, I developed an algorithm in MATLAB to analyze 20,000 images obtained from an experiment. I also formulated a mathematical model for the fluid flow, including surfactant kinematics, to simulate experimental results. My work on this project recognized the direct impact on fluid flow applications concerning Superhydrophobic surfaces and decontamination processes.
