## 👨🏽‍💻 Experience

**Software Engineer** @ [Outthink](https://outthink.io/) _(March 2023 - Present)_

OutThink revolutionises security awareness training by using data science and machine learning to measure human risk, automate improvement actions, and deliver targeted training and phishing simulations, based on employees' attitudes and security behaviours.

Working on multiple projects spanning backend systems and data analytics using .NET and python.

- **_Technologies used:_** ASP.NET Core 6 Web API, C#, Python, Azure Synapse, ADLS
  <br><br>

**Services developer** @ [Pets at Home](https://www.petsathome.com/) _(Nov 2021 - March 2023)_ <br>
Pets at Home is the UK's leading pet care business, providing food, toys and bedding, grooming services and veterinary services.

Taking ownership of enterprise-level internal systems to provide a unique identity for customers and products across the whole business. These systems are also responsible for setting the enterprise standard for how we develop APIs and services.

**Responsibilities:**

- Developing APIs for providing customer and product data to the rest of the business

- Developing intermediate APIs which handle all of the orchestration and combining of different data sources and APIs for the front end team so they only need to talk to one API for all their requirements

- Building and maintaining common projects so the rest of the back-end teams can quickly set up new APIs with the right enterprise standards

- Created an Azure DevOps pipeline to build, test, and publish an Azure DevOps extension to Visual Studio marketplace and share with our organisation

- Containerised the front-end apps using Docker so they can be tested in the CI stage of deployment with testing tools such as [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) and [lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse#readme)

- Recognized the issues with the current requirement procurement process and advocated for a shift to business-driven requirements rather than solution-driven requirements
<!-- This approach streamlined the procurement phase as the Product Owner could focus on the business requirements rather than how they should be implemented. It also allowed for faster development as it empowered the development team to implement the business logic with the best solution rather than what was decided in the requirements. -->

- **_Technologies used:_** ASP.NET Core 6 Web API, C#, Docker, Node.js, Azure, Pipelines
