I'm a backend developer based in Manchester with expertise in building scalable, data-driven solutions using .NET Core, C#, Python, and cloud platforms like Azure. I have extensive experience with databases, including SQL Server and CosmosDB, and a strong foundation in Test Driven Development (TDD) and SOLID principles. I excel at aligning technical solutions with business priorities to deliver the greatest value, bringing a results-driven approach to every project. I am open to hybrid roles in Manchester or fully remote opportunities. \

- Created an Azure DevOps pipeline to build, test, and publish an Azure DevOps extension to Visual Studio marketplace and share with our organisation
- Containerised the front-end apps using Docker so they can be tested in the CI stage of deployment with testing tools such as [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) and [lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse#readme)
- Recognized the issues with the current requirement procurement process and advocated for a shift to business-driven requirements rather than solution-driven requirements
